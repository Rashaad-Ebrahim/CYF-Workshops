# Code comprehension

Remember to **preview a markdown file** on your computer you can do:
Ctrl + Shift + V (Windows/Linux) or CMD + Shift + V (Mac)

Consider the code in this program below:

```js
function calculateSum(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

function logSum(a, b) {
  console.log(a + b);
}

const result1 = calculateSum(10, 32);
const result2 = logSum(10, 32);
```

a) what will `result1` evaluate to? Explain your answer

b) What will `result2` evaluate to? Explain your answer

c) Try to summarise the main difference between `logSum` and `calculateSum`


// Answers

a) result1 will return a value. The calculateSum function will save the outsome in result1. The answer will not show on the console.

b) The logSum function will only log the answer, it will not store the answer in result2.

c) logSum will show you the answer on the console but it won't be saved anywhere. calculateSum will save the result in a variable.
